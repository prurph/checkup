#CheckUp

##CheckUp is a lightweight, easy way to track the time you spend each day doing major tasks.

###Using CheckUp is easy!

-  [Sign up!](http://checkupapp.herokuapp.com) This app is on Heroku so please be patient if the dyno has gone to sleep. Once the page loads the first time future navigation will be quick.
-  Visit the Setup page to configure your activities. Create categories (like "Work", "Personal", "Family") and specific tags within them that represent events. You might track specific projects at work as a means of billing clients, or figuring out how much time you spent running vs. visiting the gym, eating out vs. cooking dinner. The idea is to represent most of the big events you do each day.
-  Add tags to your routine on the Setup page using the arrows. The tags within the routine can then be ordered and saved. We suggest ordering tags to match the general schedule of your day (i.e. Breakfast > Commute > Work > Lunch > etc.)
-  Once you're all set up, visit the Routines page to begin tracking activities. Simply click a button to register that you are starting an activity, and click another button when you move to something else. One tag can be active at a time--indicated by the timer icon--and the text display represents how much time you've spent on that event today. This is designed to be fast and flexible, so when you pull out your phone at lunch, on your way home or when you're sitting down to watch TV, take two seconds and CheckUp! The timer keeps running indefinitely, so don't worry about closing your browser or navigating away from the page, but also don't forget to switch or stop events to reflect your activity or it will skew your data!
-  After you've accumulated a few days of data, visit the Events page where you can view time spent over a specified date range. Events are available for display when each day ends (time for the current display is depicted on the Routines page). Time will be broken down by category and specific events; click the bars to expand or contract them to see where you're spending your time!

###Notes on the code!
This project was completed by [Prescott Murphy](http://github.com/prurph), [Yiyang Song](http://github.com/songyiyang) and [Praggya Barretto](http://github.com/prbarretto) for [General Assembly's Web Development Immersive Course](http://generalassemb.ly/wdi). It was written in a week using Ruby, Rails and JavaScript, with testing using RSpec, FactoryGirl, Capybara and PhantomJS. We're proud of our work and would be delighted to discuss. Thanks for looking!
